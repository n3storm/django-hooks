   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to django-hooks
=======================

A modular plugin system for django apps.

There are 3 kinds of hooks:

* TemplateHook: Third-party apps will be able to insert their own code (text/html) into an app template.
* FormHook: Third-party apps will be able to insert Forms in an app view.
* ViewHook: This is deprecated in favor of FormHook
* SignalHook: Connect or emit a signal by its name/id.
  This is the same as Django signals except that they don't need to be pre-defined.

This documentation is divided into different parts.
I recommend that you get started with the Installation and then head over to the Usage.
